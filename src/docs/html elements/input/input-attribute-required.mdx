ideas:
    - Try removing the 'required' attribute and then submit the form without a value in the field.
    - Try removing the field element completely.

# attribute - 'required'

The 'required' attribute prevents a form being submitted when any input field (`input`, `select`), with this attribute present, does not have a value.

e.g.

```
<input type="text" name="author" required/>
<input type="text" name="title" required="yes/>
```

NOTE: the `required` attribute does not need a value, and any value can be used for the attribute e.g. `required="required"`, `"required="blue apples"`

Like any other `boolean` attribute, I'm suspicious if a `required` attribute has a value, this often means that the people working on the front end don't fully understand HTML and may indicate that I need to look at the implementation of the GUI more closely.
