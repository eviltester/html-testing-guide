cssSelector: 'input[type="number"]'
ideas:
    - Number may include characters you don't expect, try them e.g. "e", ".","-","+"
    - Try changing the type to "text" and submitting a very invalid input.

# `type="number"`

Number is not restricted to positive Integer so it is possible to add characters that the server or follow on functionality is not expecting e.g. "-.e" so we need to try the full range of input characters.
